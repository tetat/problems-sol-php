Problem 2:
Given a few paragraphs in a file, read the file and count how many words are there. 
For example, if there is a file with the following contents:

Nunc ex lorem, ullamcorper ut eleifend ac, pellentesque non dolor.  

You need to output: 10

Because there are 10 words. 
Note: There can be multiple paragraphs. You need to count all of the words from all of the paragraphs. 
You need to read the data from a file.
