Problem 3:
Given a sentence, keep the order of the words same, but reverse the characters of each word. 
For example, if the given sentence is: ‘I love programming’ 
The result should be: ‘I evol gnimmargorp’

Here the order of the words is the same as the given sentence, but the order of the characters in the words is reversed.
